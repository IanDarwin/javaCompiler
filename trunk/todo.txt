1.1
	- GUI Linux: no jvm.dll, java.dll, verify.dll -> libutil.so
	- Manual: Ok for version 1.1?
	- Compile lin and win: lib directory problem
	- Optimization and packing expensive. Into manual or gui?

Regression between rev 121200 (used for v1.1) and 121400:
  AWT/Swing doesn't start anymore.
    SunGraphicsEnvironment does: noType1Font = NativeFontWrapper.getType1FontVar();
    which crashes and for some reason doesn't call the jni method

1.2
	- Flags for GCJ: possibility to edit them and the order has to be kept
	- Jar archives: order if one depends on another? archives import left-to-right or right-to-left
	- Excluding libs (show pulled in libs)

	- "cancel" compilation

	- dwarf exception handling
	- GUI 1.5
	- upx with progress bar
	- upx quality setting: best (very good compression, very slow), 9 (good compression, slow), ... , 1 (bad compression, fast)
	- shared compilation, not only static
