	- GUI Windows: fix Test 09

FreshMeat and co...

1.2
	- Way slower since 4.3?
	- GUI: load util before all dependant libraries (not only before awt)
	- GUI Linux: make LD_LIBRARY_PATH unnecessary (m_image, maybe others)
	- Flags for GCJ: possibility to edit them and the order has to be kept
	- Jar archives: order if one depends on another? archives import left-to-right or right-to-left
	- Excluding libs (show pulled in libs)

	- "cancel" compilation

	- dwarf exception handling
	- GUI 1.5
	- upx with progress bar
	- upx quality setting: best (very good compression, very slow), 9 (good compression, slow), ... , 1 (bad compression, fast)
	- shared compilation, not only static
