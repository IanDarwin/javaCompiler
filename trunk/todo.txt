- automated mingw gcj tester (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm)
- http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=30937
- GUI
	Both: Date test fails because of java.text.
	Win: GUI apps still seldom just exit after start
	Win: DND example sometimes failes while dragging. On Linux too?
	Lin: focus problems with AWT editor. sometimes impossible to edit the text
- GCJ Way slower since 4.3?
- findirect-dispatch broken with jars? mingw only?
- Flags for GCJ: possibility to edit them and the order has to be kept
- Jar archives: order if one depends on another? archives import left-to-right or right-to-left
- Excluding libs (show pulled in libs)
- "cancel" compilation
- dwarf exception handling
- GUI 1.5
- upx with progress bar
- upx quality setting: best (very good compression, very slow), 9 (good compression, slow), ... , 1 (bad compression, fast)
- shared compilation, not only static
