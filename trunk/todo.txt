GCJ
- read http://gcc.gnu.org/contribute.html#standards
- merge patches, commit or delete already commited
- Make backup / merge d: and linux laptop with external hd
- lin-lin doesn't work with "--with-sysroot". probably a regression (linux/limits.h and linux/errno.h not found)
- findirect-dispatch broken with jars?
- automated mingw gcj tester (http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/CompileFarm)
