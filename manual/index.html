		<h2>Create/Open a project</h2>
		Here you can open a saved project or create a new one. Nothing fancy...
		
		<a name="1"></a>
		<h2>Step 1 of 4: Source</h2>
		Here you can specify the source of your application.<br>
		You can add:
		<ul>
				<li>Single .java or .class files</li>
				<li>Directories (subdirectories will be included) from which all
					.java and .class files will be used</li>
				<li>Jars</li>
		</ul>
			
		Each jar has an additional checkbox. It specifies if the whole jar
		or only needed (referenced) classes should be included into the final binary.
		Including only the needed classes will - who would have guessed that -
		result in smaller binaries. But there is a price tag attached to that:
		If a class is never referenced and only loaded
		by reflection, it will not be in the executable and thus a ClassNotFoundException
		will be thrown at runtime. To force the inclusion of such classes,
		you have to add a reference to them into your code.<br><br>
		
		An example to illustrate the problem and to show how to solve it:<br>
		SWT does not reference the handlers for the various image types.
		Looking at the source shows that the classes PNGFileFormat, JPEGFileFormat,
		WinICOFileFormat, ... from the package org.eclipse.swt.internal.image are
		loaded by Class.forName() when a user creates an image.
		Thus, references to the needed image handlers have to be added in the
		own application:

<pre>static
{
	org.eclipse.swt.internal.image.PNGFileFormat.class.getName();
	org.eclipse.swt.internal.image.JPEGFileFormat.class.getName();
	org.eclipse.swt.internal.image.WinICOFileFormat.class.getName();
}</pre>

	In the case of SWT, this is not yet enough. These classes are protected, not public.
	So just create a dummy class in the org.eclipse.swt.internal.image package and add
	the initializer to that class...

	<h2>Step 2 of 4: Basic settings (required)</h2>

	<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Setting</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Main class*</td>
		<td>You have to specify the class of your application that contains the main() method.
			This the same as when calling "java foo.bar.MyMainClass".</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>java.library.path</td>
			<td>You might want to specify the java.library.path.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Use CNI instead of JNI</td>
			<td>Check this box if you use native code by CNI instead of JNI.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Windows*</td>
			<td>Specify if a binary for Windows has to be created.
				If yes, you have to provide a location for it.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Icon</td>
			<td>On Windows, you can set an icon for you executables. It will be
				visible in the Windows Explorer.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Hide console</td>
			<td>On Windows, a console will be opened when executing the compiled application.
				While this is needed for console applications, it is mostly
				unnecessary for GUI applications. It can be hidden with this option.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Linux*</td>
			<td>Specify if a binary for Linux has to be created.
				If yes, you have to provide a location for it.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Mac</td>
			<td>Not yet supported...</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Omit stripping</td>
			<td>Symbols of the binary will be stripped by default. This won't need additional time and the binary
				will be much smaller. You can turn it of with this option.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Omit packing</td>
			<td>The binaries will be packed by default. This needs a lot of additional time but will result
				in much smaller binaries. You can turn it off with this option.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Disable optimization</td>
			<td>The code to compile will be optimized by default. That needs some additional time but will result in
				smaller and faster binaries. You can turn it off with this option.</td>
		</tr>

	<table border="1">
		<tr>
			<th>Setting</th>
			<th>Description</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Custom GCJ flags</td>
			<td>Here you can specify additional flags for GCJ. Multiple flags are
				separated by spaces or newlines.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Show used commands</td>
			<td>If checked, the used commands for compiling the application will
				be shown during compilation.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Exclude GUI</td>
			<td>You can exclude the GUI part of the class library. It gets pulled
				into the binary by default. This will result in much smaller binaries
				but you have to ensure that you do not use any of these classes. Else
				you end up with compilation errors.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Exclude JCE</td>
			<td>You can exclude the "Java Cryptography Extension" of the class library.
				It gets pulled into the binary by default. This will result in smaller
				binaries but you have to ensure that you do not use any of these classes.
				Else you end up with compilation errors.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Add GNU regex</td>
			<td>This is needed if there are invalid regular expressions in the compiled code.<br>
				Without it, you will get this runtime error:<br>
				java.util.MissingResourceException: Bundle gnu/java/util/regexp/MessagesBundle not found</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Don't cache compiled jars</td>
			<td>By default, compiled jars will be saved in the same directory as the jar. By doing so,
				it can be reused in later compilations (what is a real time saver). You can turn it off with this option.</td>

	<h2>Step 4 of 4: Compilation</h2>
	
	Here you can finally hit the "compile" button :-)<br>
	If you check "Beep when done", it will beep once if the compilation
	succeeds and twice if it fails.
